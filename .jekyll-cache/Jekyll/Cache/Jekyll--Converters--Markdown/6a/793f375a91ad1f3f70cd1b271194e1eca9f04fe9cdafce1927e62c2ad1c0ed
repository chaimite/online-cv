I"K<p>I obtained a final grade of 7.24 (2:1 in the UK).
My bachelor project was an automation project, where one of my
tasks was to create a program that could recognize different part
types as well as calculate the distances needed between reference
points, to where a machine would have to move, by using Computer vision tools.</p>
